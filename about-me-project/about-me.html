                        <h4>I love to travel.</h4>
                        <p>I love being able to travel whenever I can. I have lived in multiple states across the U.S. and have also lived for two years in Italy. During my time in Italy, I was able to travel across Europe multiple times. My favorite places to visit were probably Octoberfest in, Rome, and Amalfi Coast. I hope to be able to travel back to Europe someday to visit more. I’d also like to visit Spain and Japan.</p>

                        <h4> Workout.</h4>.</h4>
                        <p>I started taking an intro to weight lifting class in high school in an attempt to get stronger and lose belly fat since I was really into sports at the time. After High school, I joined the army and continued to lift to get stronger and keep up in the infantry. Eventually, I wanted to keep going for my mental health. I see it as an opportunity to stay healthy, zone out, and listen to my favorite music. Now my personal goal is to look like an anime character one day.</p>

                        <h4>Play too many video games.</h4>
                        <p>I didn’t have much growing up, but I remember first playing the Atari 2600 at my uncle's house and being immediately hooked. After a few years, my parents gave me my first console for my birthday, the Nintendo 64. My favorite games were Super Mario and Space Invaders. I then shared multiple consoles throughout the years with my siblings. It was a way for us to pass the time and have fun as best we could. During my deployment with the help of a friend, I ordered parts to build my first PC. Now I love to play games as a way to connect with friends and family that I don’t get to see every day and I’m now able to do amazing things such as build a website.</p>

                        <h4>Wacth ani.</h4>
                        <p>You could say I’m fairly new to Anime compared to some who grew up watching it. Before 2021, the extent of my Anime had been Yu-Gi-Oh and a little of Dragon Ball Z.
                            I have a few friends who are Anime enthusiasts and begged me to watch my “First one” which happened to be Demon Slayer. I was immediately hypnotized by the incredible art design and storytelling that I felt I was missing in everyday TV shows. I have since then watched far more shows than I care to admit. Some of my favorites, for now, range from Attack on Titan, Naruto, Tokyo Ghoul, Kaguya-Sama: Love is war, Classroom of the Elite, My hero Academia, Black clover, and many more. I also did not know I would be such a sucker for a slice of life…
