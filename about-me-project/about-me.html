                        <h4>I love to travel.</h4>
                        <p>I love being able to travel whenever I can. I have lived in multiple states across the U.S. and have also lived for two years in Italy. During my time in Italy, I traveled across Europe numerous times. My favorite places to visit were Rome and the Amalfi Coast. I also enjoyed visiting Germany during Oktoberfest. In the future, I hope to be able to travel back to Europe someday, and I would also like to visit Spain and Japan.</p>

                        <h4> Workout.</h4>
                        <p>I took an introductory weightlifting class in high school to get stronger and slim down since I was really into sports. After high school, I joined the Army and continued lifting to strengthen my body and keep up in the infantry. Eventually, I wanted to keep working out to benefit my mental health. Exercising allows me to stay healthy, zone out, and listen to my favorite music. One day I will achieve my newest goal and look like an anime character.</p>

                        <h4>Play too many video games.</h4>
                        <p>I did not have much growing up, but the moment I played my uncle's Atari 2600, I was hooked! On my birthday a few years later, my parents gifted me my first console, the Nintendo 64. My favorite games were Super Mario and Space Invaders. Over the next couple of years, I shared multiple consoles with my siblings. Video games were a way to pass the time and have fun as best we could. Then, during my deployment, with the help of a friend, I ordered parts to build my first PC. Now I love to play games to connect with friends and family that I do not get to see every day, and I can now do amazing things such as build a website!</p>

                        <h4>Wacth Anime.</h4>
                        <p>You could say I am relatively new to anime compared to those who grew up watching it. Before 2021, the extent of my anime experience included Yu-Gi-Oh and Dragon Ball Z. I have a few friends who are anime enthusiasts and begged me to watch my first "true anime." I ended up starting with Demon Slayer. Once again, I was instantly hooked! The art design was incredible, and the storytelling was very fulfilling. Two things that I feel are missing in everyday TV shows. Since then, I have watched far more shows than I care to admit! Some of my favorites are Attack on Titan, Naruto, Tokyo Ghoul, Kaguya-Sama: Love is War, Classroom of the Elite, My Hero Academia, Black Clover, and so many more. Who would have thought I would be such a sucker for a slice of life!</p>
