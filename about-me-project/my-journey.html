                        <h4 id="Childhood">Childhood</h4>
                        <p>I was born on January 19, 1997, in Jacksonville, Florida. I am the oldest of three children. I have a brother, Tyler, and a sister, Sarah. When I was four years old, I began playing baseball. Soon after, I dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player. When I turned nine, my parents divorced. A few years later, my dad moved us to Spokane, Washington. We would fly to North Carolina during the summers to see our mom. Once I finished freshman year, I decided to move in with my mom in North Carolina.</p>

                        <p>I attended two different high schools. I spent my freshman year at University High School in Washington. Once I moved to North Carolina, I spent the next three years at C.A. Erwin High School. I was heavily involved in sports during high school! I played football, wrestled, ran track, and was in the JROTC (Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps) program. During my Junior year, I decided to join the Army after graduation. I graduated high school in June 2015.</p>

                        <p>I enlisted as an 11B Infantryman with an Airborne option. On June 30, 2015, I left for basic training. I spent sixteen weeks training to become an infantryman and graduated on October 16, 2015. Immediately after graduation, I started Airborne School. Later, I received orders to go to Ft. Hood, Texas. While in Texas, I spent my time in a long-range surveillance company followed by a scout platoon.</p>

                        <h4 id="Deployment">Deployment</h4>
                        <p>I was deployed to Iraq and Syria in July 2018. I was attached to Apache Troop as a Scout Platoon Team Leader. As a Team Leader, I was in charge of three other junior soldiers. While deployed, we experienced many things together as a team. By late January 2019, we had accomplished our mission and safely brought everyone from our platoon home.</p>

                        <p>Shortly after my time in Iraq and Syria, I received orders to join the 173rd in Italy. I arrived in July 2019 during the hottest summer ever recorded! The training was extremely demanding, but the time we had to travel made it all worth it. I saw a lot of Italy and parts of Germany. However, in February 2020, my travels were cut short due to the COVID pandemic. Once traveling home was possible, I applied to become a helicopter pilot through the Warrant program and was selected to attend the course!</p>

                        <p>I departed Italy in July 2021. Once in the States, I attended the Warrant Officer Candidate School in August and graduated in September. Unfortunately, shortly after graduation, I was no longer eligible to fly helicopters due to medical reasons. Even though this was not the outcome I expected, I still felt proud of my accomplishments. After this news, I worked as a tax preparer and an aide to a colonel. Finally, in August 2022, I was honorable discharged.</p>

                        <p>Today, I live in Jacksonville, Florida! I am enrolled in the Vet Tech course learning Java and how to become a proper software engineer. Currently, I am studying to take the certification exam. I hope that it will help me land a job in the field. If all goes according to plan, I would like to buy a house in a few years and then use my G.I. Bill to earn a degree in computer science.</p>
